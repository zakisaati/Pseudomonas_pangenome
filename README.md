To inspect the codes and programs used to annotate genomes or proteomes, and to evaluate genome completeness and quality go to the [genomes_annotation](./analyses/genomes_annotation.md) section

To see how we create the phylogenetic tree, go to [phylogeny](./analyses/phylogeny.md)

To see how we built an analyze the _Pseudomonas_ pangenome, and then searched for proteins or functions associated with the _Pseudomonas_ isolation sources go to [pangenome_creation_and_enrichment_analyses](./analyses/pangenome_creation_and_enrichment_analyses.md)
